        <p>The attraction of design was always present in my life but what I did not realize was how great of an impact it really was on me until now. My junior year of high school was the beginning stage of my design curiosity when I enrolled in a web design
            class. Fascinated by my ability to create my own websites, it was not enough to overshadow my passions for baseball and automobiles at the time. Web design was always in the back of my mind but it never reestablished itself back into my life
            until many years later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I clearly did not become the first baseman for the Oakland Athletics or an aspiring BMW automotive mechanic and I found myself completely lost in my career path for a great amount of time. After many years of carrying odd jobs and wondering what
            I should do for the rest of my life, I was encouraged to get my foot in the IT field. I finally received my Associates Degree in 2018 and began my short lived IT journey. I carried a heavy interest in computers growing up so I thought I had
            finally found my career. But I was wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Discouraged and frustrated on not knowing what to do, I reflected back to a moment where I held a job in healthcare as a Billing Representative. This was a company that I was really happy to be a part of but unfortunately, there was no future
            for me there.However, I took away many significant qualities that lead me to become a designer today. The reason why everyone in the insurance department was so successful was because we were problem solvers. Despite our roles, we would collaborate
                often to solve issues.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And because of the dynamic of our team, we were successful in every possible way. And lastly, the company had a horrible website. Many clients would call in and would lash their frustrations on me because of the lack
            of accessibility the website carried. This issue rejuvenated the memories of taking my web design class as I knew I was capable of fixing this issue on the website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From that moment on, I quit my job and I took a web design class at Foothill College just to be confident this was the path I was going for. Frightened that it may not work out again, I went for it anyways. It turns out that the fun I had in high
            school all came back to me again once I enrolled in the class. I was confident this was exactly what I wanted to do and here I am today designing applications and websites.</p>
        <br>
        <p> My goal is to be able to create work that avoids common design issues and solve them in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. There are many websites and applications I run into daily that are not user friendly and that the design
         can be drastically improved. I want to be able to solve these problems so that clients are able to realize how important design impacts their business. </p>
